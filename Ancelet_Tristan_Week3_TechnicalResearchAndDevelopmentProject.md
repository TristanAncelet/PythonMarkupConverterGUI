<paper-title> Technical Research & Development Project </paper-title>


For my project I will be creating a Markup Language Conversion Application. The technology that will be involved (at the start) is the following: Python and Markup Languages (ML). Python will be used to facilitate the conversion from one ML to another. The MLs are used to store data into a format that is easily transferable and parsible between different software and systems. To begin with everything is just being used to be able to create software that will convert one ML to another. The end goal for the next iteration of this project however is to be able to setup a simple API server that would allow for one type of request to come in and be converted into another (REST/JSON -> SOAP/XML).


\
To begin with there are a few features that are planned for the first itteration of this project. For the start features will include:
- Cross Platform UI using Python & Kivy
- Cross-Converting many different Markup Languages
- UI/TUI/CLI independent markup conversion python library
- A sqlite database to store different states of your conversion (as well as to allow for the user to view their history).

The features mentioned above are simply for the first itteration of the project. Which will be built upon for any future itteration. 


\
Research that was done for this project was a few things: 
- The state of the industry today, and how software systems communicate with one another. 
- How systems collect and store service/billing information.


\
What has been built for this project so far:
- Rudimentary Front-End UI using Python3 and Kivy
- Beginnings of the conversion library
